# Google-Books

For this project, this entails refactoring code from restful APIs to GRaphQL from an already functioning website.  The website should function the same.

Here I modified the middleware, imported the ApolloServer, and created an ApolloProvider.

The website should do the following:
* search books
* save books
* sign in, log in, and log out users
